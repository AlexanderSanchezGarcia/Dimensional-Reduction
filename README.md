# Dimensional-Reduction
In this report, the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset was used to explore and compare three dimensionality reduction techniques:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Sammon Projection, and Autoencoders. Each technique was applied to reduce the dimensions of the dataset, while maintaining
as much relevant information as possible. The results allowed us to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of each method in
representing the data, highlighting the advantages and limitations in terms of
interpretability, computational complexity, and preservation of the original structure of the dataset. This analysis provides a comprehensive
view of how these tools can be used in medical diagnostic problems, where dimensionality reduction is crucial to improve the interpretation and
processing of complex data.
